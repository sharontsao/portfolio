        <span class="usersurveys">
          <h4>USER SURVEYS</h4>
          <p>I conducted a survey to better understand the current habits and complaints of cloud storage users. </p>
          <h6>93%</h6>
          <p>use cloud storage for personal use</p>
          <h6>50%</h6>
          <p>use cloud storage for business use</p>

          <p>work in a collaborative environment</p>
          <h6>88%</h6>
          <p>of students use cloud storage</p>
          <p>Survey participants indicated their essential cloud storage features, in order of importance:</p>
          <p><span class="circlenumber">1</span></p>
          <p>File upload</p>
          <p><span class="circlenumber">2</span></p>

        <span class="competitiveanalysis">
          <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
          <p>Evernote is approachable for new users and has effective mobile navigation.</p>
          <i class="fab fa-google-drive"></i>
          <p>Google Drive is great for personal use, scalable to small teams, and has strong collaboration features. </p>
          <i class="fab fa-dropbox"></i>
          <p>Dropbox is robust for large teams and Paper is easy to use. </p>
          <p>Mobile navigation is a prominent pain point for Google Drive and Dropbox.</p>

        <span class="interviews">
          <h4>INTERVIEWS &amp; PERSONAS</h4>
          <p>From analyzing the survey results and holding in-depth interviews, I identified two user personas: student and businessperson. Both user groups held file organization and collaboration of high importance. Their main motivations differed in price point: students need cheap storage options while businesspeople will pay for robust storage space.  </p>

      <span class="userstories">
        <h4>USER STORIES</h4>
        <p>Based on the client brief and the user research performed so far, I created a list of 53 user stories. Putting myself in each persona’s shoes, I narrowed it down to five user stories that encompassed the heart of SkySpace and served as the MVP. </p>
        <p><span class="circlenumber">1</span></p>
        <p>Onboarding</p>

        <h5>Brand Identity</h5></div>

        <span class="Brandstory">
          <p>As I began to brainstorm through word association and sketching exercises, “Bringing order to the vastness of the imagination” became a mission statement for my product. Ultimately, I chose “SkySpace” to reflect this. </p>
          <img class="full-width" src="assets/images/logosketch.png" alt="logosketch">
          <p>The sketching process progressed from space motifs to, finally, a geometric form of the letter “S”  that reveals different layers and planes. The geometric shape was built from a grid, which gives the design a solid, dependable foundation.</p>
          <img class="full-width" src="assets/images/purplogo.png" alt="purple logo">
        </span>

        <span class="toneofvoice">
          <h4>TONE OF VOICE</h4>
          <p>Dependable</p>
          <p>Our users depend on us to provide a trustworthy, secure service that adapts to changing technology and user needs.</p>
          <p>Versatile</p>
          <p>This application is used for leisure, business and everything in between. We think it’s important that we provide a platform for an individual’s or team’s craft, whatever it might be.</p>
          <p>Approachable</p>
          <p>SkySpace is designed to be friendly - straightforward and without clutter. It’s meant to be inclusive for any age or ability.</p>

          <div class="square"></div>
          <div class="square2"></div>
          <p>Navy and Galaxy Purple gave the product a soothing feeling. In a world of digital clutter and stress, users need a product that emotes calmness. Used for call to actions and system feedback.</p>
          <div class="square3"></div>
          <div class="square4"></div>
          <p>Lilac and Grey are playful complementary colors that are friendly and approachable. The overall purple tone conveys creativity and dependability.</p>

        <h5>Prototypes &amp; Testing</h5></div>

        <span class="wireframes">
          <h4>WIREFRAMES &amp; LO-FI PROTOTYPE</h4>
          <p>Building on the sitemap and user flows, I sketched the main screen of the five essential tasks. Next, to visualize each screen and each interaction necessary to complete the task, I created a clickable low-fidelity prototype in InVision.</p>
          <img class="full-width" src="assets/images/lofi.png" alt="lofi wireframes">
          <button type="button" name="lofi">VIEW LO-FI PROTOTYPE</button>
        </span>

        <span class="usability">
          <h4>USABILITY TESTING: PRELIMINARY ROUNDS</h4>
          <p>Following a usability test script, I conducted testing on the low-fidelity prototype with volunteers over Skype. Maze testing allowed me to gain insight from more people in a shorter amount of time. </p>
          <p>Action items:</p>
          <p>Make language more direct</p>
          <p>Unite button design</p>
          <p>Remove "save button from the content creation screen"</p>
          <img class="full-width" src="assets/images/save.png" alt="content creation screen">
          <p>KEY TAKEAWAY Usability testing allowed me to disassociate from my biases and integrate user- centered interpretations. In-person testing was optimal for systematic observation of facial expressions and other body language. Remote testing using Maze was valuable, too, in its ability to capture feedback from many people.</p>
        </span>

        <span class="hifi">
          <h4>HI-FI PROTOTYPE &amp; TESTING</h4>
          <p>In this stage, I integrated color, branding, images and icons to give SkySpace its personality. Alignment, emphasis, sizing and proximity of elements changed tremendously between iterations. </p>
          <button type="button" name="mobile prototype">VIEW MOBILE PROTOTYPE</button>
          <button type="button" name="desktop prototype">VIEW DESKTOP PROTOTYPE</button>
          <p>Action items:</p>
          <p>Provide better system feedback to confirm actions</p>
          <p>Clean up global navigation issues with “New” button and search bar</p>
          <div><img class="full-width" src="assets/images/new1.png" alt="new1"> </div>
          <div><img class="full-width" src="assets/images/new2.png" alt="new2"> </div>
          <p>The “+/New” button in the vertical strip was visually appealing but had some usability flaws. To bypass the navigation issues that users had in testing, I decided to place the search bar at the top of the screen. The “+/New” button is now larger and more visible. In a UsabilityHub preference test pitting these two layouts against each other, the second layout won by a small margin of 2 people out of 20 participants.</p>
          <p>Better utilize vertical space</p>
          <div><img class="full-width" src="assets/images/mobiles.png" alt="mobile screens"> </div>
          <p>Since I was building this mobile prototype for a website, instead of an app, I wanted to give more real estate to the vertical space. The navigation bar is not that essential to a user on his or her phone and, so, got condensed into a hamburger menu in the upper left corner.</p>
          <p>KEY TAKEAWAY In the future, I would spend more time ensuring my low-fidelity wireframes were testing seamlessly before jumping into the next phase of adding detail and color. This means more testing earlier in the process and more iterations to optimize functionality in the low-fidelity stage. </p>

        <div class="chnum"><h1>05</h1>
          <h5>Conclusion</h5></div>

        <span class="learning">
            <h4>LEARNING MOMENTS</h4>
            <p>SkySpace taught me that the constant feedback loop of “build, measure, implement and repeat” is invaluable. </p>
            <p>One of my most critical takeaways in this process came to me while writing this case study. Articulating my design decisions in a compelling and systematic way was my biggest challenge. Writing out my process forced me to challenge my preconceived notions, reveal my weaknesses, and bring a sense of awareness to my actions. </p>
